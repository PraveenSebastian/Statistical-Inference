This repository contains the codes and final project code for  for the Statistical Inference course on Coursera.

Final Project :

Overview
This is the course project for the Coursera Statistical Inference class. It analyzes the
exponential distribution in R and applies the Central Limit Theorem to a thousand
simulations.
This work investigates the exponential distribution in R and compares it with the Central
Limit Theorem.The project explains with simulation and explaratory texts through
1.Simulation Exercise 2.Basic Inferential Data Analysis

Overview
The report analyzes the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. The following would be the main objectives of this course assignment:
1.Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 2.Provide a basic summary of the data. 3.Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if thereâ€™s other approaches worth considering) 4.State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
